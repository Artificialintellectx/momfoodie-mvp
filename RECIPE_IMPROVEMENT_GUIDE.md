- **Instructions (40 points)**: Clarity, timing, technique
- **Metadata (20 points)**: Completeness and accuracy

### 3. **Common Issues to Fix**

#### **Vague Ingredients**
‚ùå **Before**: "Onions", "Pepper", "Oil"
‚úÖ **After**: "Onions (1 medium, diced)", "Scotch bonnet pepper (1 piece, chopped)", "Palm oil (1/2 cup)"

#### **Unclear Instructions**
‚ùå **Before**: "Cook until done"
‚úÖ **After**: "Simmer on medium heat until sauce thickens and oil rises to surface (about 15-20 minutes)"

#### **Missing Details**
‚ùå **Before**: "Blend ingredients"
‚úÖ **After**: "Blend tomatoes, peppers, and onions until smooth (not too watery)"

## üç≥ Nigerian Cooking Techniques

### **Frying with Palm Oil**
- Heat palm oil until hot (test with a drop of water - it should sizzle)
- Fry until golden brown on both sides
- Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil

### **Cooking Rice**
- Use 2:1 ratio of water to rice for fluffy results
- Parboil rice for 5 minutes before final cooking
- Let rice steam for 10 minutes after cooking

### **Blending Ingredients**
- Blend tomatoes until smooth but not watery
- Blend beans with minimal water for thick consistency
- Chop vegetables roughly before blending

### **Seasoning**
- Add seasoning cubes and salt towards the end of cooking
- Use 1 seasoning cube per 500g of meat/protein
- Taste and adjust seasoning before serving
